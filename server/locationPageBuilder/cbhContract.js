// ── Clear Behavioral Health page contract ───────────────────────────────────
// The client's "Guidelines for Building the Sections", as data.
//
// ONE source of truth, because three places have to agree about every number
// in it: the writer prompt (what the model is asked for), the QC gates (what
// is accepted), and the brief + wizard (what the SEO team is shown). The
// dental side learned this the hard way -- its paragraph cap was written out
// twice and editing one silently decoupled the instruction from the gate.
//
// This contract REPLACES the dental section shape for CBH. It is not a
// variation on it: the dental body is 7-8 flat H2 blocks of HTML with headings
// forbidden inside, and this is ten sections, one of which nests 4-5
// H3s under a single H2.
//
// Every limit here is a MAXIMUM from the guidelines unless the name says
// otherwise. Character counts are on rendered text, never on markup.

const BRAND = 'Clear Behavioral Health';

// The suffix appended to every meta title. The 50-60 window is measured on the
// title WITHOUT it (confirmed with the client: the full tag runs past Google's
// truncation point on purpose, so the brand is what gets cut).
const TITLE_SUFFIX = ` | ${BRAND}`;

// Fixed headings. These are copied verbatim onto the page -- the guidelines
// say "use this H2 exactly as written" -- so they are not model output and the
// writer is never asked to produce them.

// ── Sentence case ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every heading on a CBH page is sentence case. It cannot be done by lowering
// everything after the first word: "Treatment" and "Anaheim" are the same
// shape, and only one of them may come down. Nothing is lowered unless it is
// known not to be a name.
//
// What counts as a name is deliberately NARROW, and it is matched as a PHRASE
// wherever the name is one. Two earlier versions got this wrong:
//
//   - protecting every capitalised word of the service name, which lower-cased
//     nothing: "Anxiety", "Depression" and "Burnout" are common nouns, and the
//     result was "Our approach to Anxiety treatment";
//   - protecting the brand word by word, which capitalised those words
//     everywhere else too: "Health" is in "Clear Behavioral Health", so
//     "outpatient mental health treatment" came out "mental Health".
//
// So single words here are only those that are ALWAYS proper, and everything
// else -- the brand, the city, the state, nearby areas -- is restored as a
// phrase after the text has been lowered.
const PROPER_NOUNS = new Set([
  // Branded medicines that appear in service names and copy. Generic
  // substances -- cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, marijuana, kratom -- are common
  // nouns and are deliberately absent.

// ── Em dashes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Banned from everything this module generates, at the client's instruction:
// no em dash in a brief, in page copy, or in a regenerated field.
//
// A prompt alone does not hold this. A model asked for 300 characters of warm
// clinical prose reaches for an em dash whether or not it was told not to, and
// the miss is invisible -- it breaks no length gate, trips no other rule, and
// reads perfectly well. So the rule is enforced in CODE at the three points
// every generated string passes through (normalizeCbhBrief, mergeCbhL3,
// cbhRegen), the prompts are written without em dashes of their own so the
// instruction is not contradicted by the text delivering it, and a QC gate
// reports any that a reviewer types by hand.
//
// ONLY the em dash (U+2014). The EN dash (U+2013) is structural in this
// module: it separates an office label from its programme ("Los Angeles – Mid
// Wilshire", see seed.js, split on by text.baseCity) and it is a legal bullet
// marker in bulletPattern below. Banning it would break both.
// Written as an escape, not as the character. Everything below is the rule's
// own implementation, and a sweep for stray em dashes across this module
// (`grep -r` before a release) should come back with prose that NAMES the
// character and nothing else.

// constructions a model actually writes -- an aside ("we treat the whole
// person — not just the symptom") or an appositive ("three formats — IOP, PHP
// and virtual — are offered here"). Deleting it instead runs the clauses
// together; a spaced hyphen is the same punctuation wearing a hat.
//
// Two places it is NOT a comma:
//   - OPENING an entry, where it is a bullet marker rather than punctuation.
//     Rewriting "— Evening sessions" to ", Evening sessions" would stop the
//     entry being a bullet, and a bullet costs a different number of lines
//     against the educational budget than the same words as prose (lineCount).
//     It is handed the canonical "-" marker the writer is asked for instead.
//   - BESIDE punctuation already doing that job, where a comma would produce
//     ". ," or ", ,".
